# RoutingNumberValidator

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tippenein/routing_number_validator.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tippenein/routing_number_validator)

Routing Number Validator is a gem intended to be a minimal application of
validations provided in larger libraries (see `ActiveMerchant`) if a more
minimal implementation is intended.

Use this gem as if it was just another ActiveModel validator (because it is)

```ruby
class MyModel < ActiveRecord
  validates :my_routing_number, :routing_number => true
end

billing_info = MyModel.new(invalid_routing_number_params)
billing_info.valid? => false
```

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'routing_number_validator'
```

then run:

    $ bundle

Then add the following to your model:

```ruby
validates :my_routing_number, :routing_number => true
```
